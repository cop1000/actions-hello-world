Nice work adding the `entrypoint.sh` script. So far, this script will help define the **action**.

Next, we'll define a **workflow** that uses the `entrypoint.sh` GitHub Action.

### Workflow Files
Workflows are defined in special files in the `.github` directory, named `main.workflow`.

Each workflow file is comprised of **blocks**, like [workflow blocks](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#workflow-blocks) and [action blocks](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#action-blocks). For this example, we'll need one of each.

### The workflow block

Workflow blocks execute anytime code is pushed to your repository, using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.

Let's take a look at what we'll be adding to the workflow file later, and break down what each part will do.

- `on = "push"` indicates that your workflow block will execute anytime code is pushed to your repository, using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.
- `resolves = ["Hello World"]` selects the action to execute using the `resolves` attribute.

## Step 3: Adding to the workflow file

First, we'll add the workflow block. We'll add the action block in a later step.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a `workflow` block to your workflow file

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, create a directory titled `.github`
1. In the new `.github` directory, create a file titled `main.workflow`
1. Add the following content to the `main.workflow` file:
    ```hcl
    workflow "New workflow" {
      on = "push"
      resolves = ["Hello World"]
    }
    ```
1. Stage and commit your changes
1. Push the branch to GitHub

The `main.workflow` file cannot edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.workflow)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
