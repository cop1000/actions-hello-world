### Your action is about to be triggered!

Your repository now contains everything it needs for the action to be defined (in the `./action-a/` folder) and everything it needs to be triggered (in the `./github/main.workflow` file).

The action will run anytime a commit is recognized on the remote repository. Since you just pushed, let's wait for the workflow to be triggered. This might take a few minutes since it's the first time running in this repository.

### Seeing your Action in Action

You can see the action status reported below, or you can click the "Actions" tab in your repository. From there you will see the actions that have run, and you can click on the action's "Log" link to view details.
