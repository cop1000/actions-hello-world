You merged and this course is now complete! I'll stop responding but the fun doesn't have to stop here.

In this repository:
- Your merge should trigger your action again, check it out in the [Actions tab]({{ repo }}/actions).
- The `Dockerfile` contains metadata for your action. Try changing some of that. You could, for example, change the icon that displays when the action is running.
- Change the `MY_NAME` environment variable to use your name instead of Mona's in `.github/main.workflow`.
- Change the `args` attribute to display a completely different message in `stdout`. 
- Change the contents of `entrypoint.sh` to do something other than outputting a message.
