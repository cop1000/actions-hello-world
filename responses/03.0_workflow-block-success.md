Nice work! :tada: You added a workflow block to your workflow file! 

Here's what it means:
- `on = "push"` indicates that your workflow block will execute anytime code is pushed to your repository, using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.
- `resolves = ["Hello World"]` selects the action to execute using the `resolves` attribute.


Next, we need to specify what action is going to be executed.

### The action block

We've referenced the `Hello World` action, but it is not defined in the `main.workflow` file. This is why there's an error regarding the workflow.

We'll add the block now, and break it down in the next step. 

## Step 4: Add a `action` block to your workflow file

Let's add the expected action to the workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an `action` block to your workflow file and commit it to your branch

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, edit `.github/main.workflow` to append the following content:
    ```hcl
    action "Hello World" {
      uses = "./action-a"
      env = {
        MY_NAME = "Mona"
      }
      args = "\"Hello world, I'm $MY_NAME!\""
    }
    ```
1. Stage and commit the changes
1. Push the changes to GitHub

<details><summary>Trouble pushing?</summary>

The `main.workflow` file cannot be edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.workflow)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
