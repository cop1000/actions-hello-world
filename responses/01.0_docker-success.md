Nice work, you committed a `Dockerfile`. You'll notice at the end of the Dockerfile, we refer to an entrypoint script.

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

The `entrypoint.sh` script will be run in Docker, and it will define what the action is really going to be doing.

## Step 2: Creating the script

We need to create that script so that Docker has something to execute.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an entrypoint script

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, create a file in the `./action-a/` directory titled `entrypoint.sh`
1. Add the following content to the `entrypoint.sh` file:
    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh -l

    sh -c "echo $*"
    ```
1. Working locally, ensure the script is executable:
    ```shell
    chmod +x action-a/entrypoint.sh
    ```
1. Stage and commit the changes
1. Push the changes to GitHub
