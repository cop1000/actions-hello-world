Nice work! :tada: You added a workflow block to your workflow file! Next, we need to specify what action is going to be executed.

### The action block

We've referenced the `Hello World` action, but it is not defined in the `main.workflow` file. This is why there's an error regarding the workflow.

We'll add the block soon, but before we do, let's learn a bit more. Here are some important details about _why_ each part of the block exists and _what_ each part does.

- `uses = "./action-a"`: the action block uses `action-a` by referencing the path to the action's directory, relative to your `hello-world-actions` repository.
- `env = { ... }`: uses the `env` action attribute to create an environment variable that will be available to your action in the runtime environment. In this case, the environment variable is `MY_NAME`, and it is currently initialized to `"Mona"`.
-  `args = "\"Hello world, I'm $MY_NAME!\""`: finally, you'll pass a string to the action in the `args` attribute. The `args` you pass are appended to the `echo` command in `entrypoint.sh` and run in a command shell. This allows you to use environment variables in the `args` attribute. See "[`ENTRYPOINT`](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-github-actions/creating-a-docker-container/#entrypoint)" for more about how the `entrypoint.sh` file works.

## Step 4: Add a `action` block to your workflow file

Let's add the expected action to the workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an `action` block to your workflow file and commit it to your branch

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, edit `.github/main.workflow` to append the following content:
    ```hcl
    action "Hello World" {
      uses = "./action-a"
      env = {
        MY_NAME = "Mona"
      }
      args = "\"Hello world, I'm $MY_NAME!\""
    }
    ```
1. Stage and commit the changes
1. Push the changes to GitHub

<details><summary>Trouble pushing?</summary>

The `main.workflow` file cannot edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.workflow)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
