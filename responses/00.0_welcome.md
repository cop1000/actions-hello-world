# Welcome

This is a companion course to the Developer Guide: [Creating a new workflow](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/creating-a-new-workflow/). For the most complete information, see the [documentation](https://developer.github.com/actions/).

There are parts of this course which will need to be completed locally, using the command line. During those steps, more instructions are provided in case you're used to working with the GitHub.com interface directly.

> Note: GitHub Actions is currently available in public beta, which means you should avoid using it for high-value workflows and content during this beta period.
>
> This course will only work for members of the GitHub Actions public beta.
