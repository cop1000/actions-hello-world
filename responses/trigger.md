Since you added these three files to your repository using the file structure above, an action will run anytime you push code to your repository. Since you just pushed, the action will be triggered. Let's wait for the workflow to be triggered. This might take a few minutes since it's the first time it runs on this repo. 

You can see the action status reported below, you you can click the "Actions" tab in your repository. From there you will see the actions that have run, and you can click on the action's "Log" link to view details.

I will respond when I detect your action has run and reported a status.
