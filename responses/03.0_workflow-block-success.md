You added a workflow block to your workflow file! Next, we need to specify what action is going to be executed.

### The action block

We've referenced the `Hello World` action, but it is not defined in the `main.workflow` file. This is why there's an error regarding the workflow.

## Step 4: Completing the workflow file

Let's add the expected action to the workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an `action` block to your workflow file

1. In your existing branch, edit `.github/main.workflow` to append the following content:
    ```hcl
    action "Hello World" {
      uses = "./action-a"
      env = {
        MY_NAME = "Mona"
      }
      args = "\"Hello world, I'm $MY_NAME!\""
    }
    ```
1. Stage and commit your changes
1. Push the branch to GitHub

The `main.workflow` file cannot edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.workflow)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
